PrintVision.cloud 🌐
====================

I got tired of managing my product line, so I made a CMS for it. It's FREE software and has a Fair Source License! It can be self-hosted. Feel free to Fork! We also have a hosted option.

This is a Next.js project bootstrapped with `create-plasmic-app`.

Getting Started 🚀
------------------

First, run the development server:

  `npm run dev`

Open your browser to see the result.

You can start editing your project in Plasmic Studio. The page auto-updates as you edit the project.
